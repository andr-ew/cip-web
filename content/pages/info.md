## I read once that the human mind never runs out of storage space -- we forget only what we cannot retrieve.

_“caught in pointers”_ is an exhibition of digital print + analog silkscreen based paintings, 3d-scanned & printed sculptures, and painted laser engravings by [Andrew CS](https://andrewcs.life) — created in parallel to their [debut album](https://leavingrecords.com/caught-in-pointers) of the same name.

_pointers (\*)_ index the world in RAM - we carry them in pockets & phone cases & microphones. throughout our time-paths - unable to collapse the infinity of a moment to megabytes, we form indices of what we cherish. our pointers are the time we can hold in our hands. we turn time on it's belly & peer into into crevices to find what we hold so tightly. but what is lost in this fallacy, & what do we find in its place ?

the artwork of _CiP_ catalogs records of temporary calm, serendipitously, from a personal archive of media & moments. memory in the mind forms misty trails, but media (ink, silicon, hard drives, magnetic tape, objects) reflect discrete imprints of time & space at a chosen resolution. make an archive of these, and you have a time capsule, a prosthetic memory, or a time travel mechanism. just as memory must define me (as a sum of my experiences) so, too, does my archive define me. I keep it close – an imprint of gestures made, places felt, treasured objects, still listening sessions, observations, time with friends, time to myself. faced with uncertain futures, _Caught in Pointers_ imagines how we may warp personal chronologies into four-dimensional volumes to navigate, reflect on, and engage with using media – a network of imperfect, but well-cherished spaces to reflect & meditate on amidst a busy forward time-path.
